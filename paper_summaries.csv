0,2015-A Multi-Modal Neuro-Physiological Study of Phishing Detection and Malware Warnings.pdf,detecting phishing attacks and heeding security warnings represent classical user-centered tasks subject to a series of prior investigations . but our understanding of user behavior underlying these tasks is still not fully mature motivating further work focusing at the neuro- physiological level governing the human processing .,there exists a num- ber of attacks and vulnerabilities underlying user-centered security systems . for example users are frequently subject to phishing at- tacks (i.e.presented with malicious websites which may look very similar to real websites) which they may fail to detect eventually undermining the privacy of their sensitive information . similar warnings are regularly shown to users in order to alert them against potential security risks .,users do not spend enough time looking at key phishing indicators and often fail at detecting these attacks . in the malware warning tasks on the other hand our results demon- strated that users frequently read and eventually heed the message embedded within the warning .further work is nec- essary to understand the effect of such interventional training on users’ performance . we suggested the possibility of building automated mechanisms applying a fusion of real-time neural and eye gaze features .
1,2015-Weakly Supervised Extraction of Computer Security Events from Twitter.pdf,twitter contains a wealth of timely information however staying on top of breaking events requires that an informa- tion analyst constantly scan many sources leading to infor- mation overload . we investigate three security-related events breaking on twitter: dos at- tacks data breaches and account hijacking . our approach greatly outperforms heuristic negatives used in most previous work .,social media provides a rich and timely source of informa- tion on events taking place in the world . enabling applica-tions such as earthquake detection or identifying the lo- cation of missing persons during natural disasters .,a weakly super-vised seed-based approach to event extraction from twitter was proposed . this leads to an unusual learning problem where only a small number of positive seeds and a sam- ple of unlabeled candidate events are available .

55,2021-SoK- Still Plenty of Phish in the Sea - A Taxonomy of User-Oriented Phishing Interventions and Avenues for Future Research.pdf,"phishing is a prevalent cyber threat targeting individuals and organizations alike . previous approaches on anti-phishing measures have started to recognize the role of the user who at the center of the target builds the last line of defense . however, user-oriented interventions are fragmented across a diverse research landscape which has not been systematized to date .",phishing is a frequently employed cyber attack to get hold of users’ sensitive information such as login details or bank- ing account numbers . furthermore criminals increasingly use cyber attacks to distribute malware . the consequences of a successful attack can reach from individual per- sonal losses or compromised accounts to complete organiza- tions or networks being infected .,. - (EL) - -________________________ -______________________ __________ __
56,2021-SquirRL- Automating Attack Analysis on Blockchain Incentive Mechanisms with Deep Reinforcement Learning.pdf,in this work we propose squirrl a framework for using deep reinforcement learning to analyze attacks on blockchain incentive mechanisms . we discover a counterintuitive flaw in the widely used rushing adversary model when applied to multi-agent markov games with incomplete information .,bitcoin’s consensus protocol requires miners to build a sequential data structure of blocks . miners receive a block reward (in bitcoins) for every block they mine that is accepted by the rest of the network .miners also receive smaller transaction fees .,squirrl gives equal or higher relative rewards compared to osm; however excess relative rewards can be negative . a rushing adversary in a multi-agent setting can actually perform worse than the honest agent . this suggests that honest agents should not necessarily be implemented as part of the environment .
